## 🌐 **Core Features**
- 📡 **Powered by AI language models:** Operated by **`GPT-3.5-Turbo`** and **`GPT-4-Turbo`** model out of the box for maximum compatibility, but easily switchable to `any other OpenAI model` via asking Miles to change it.
- 🎵 **Integrated with Spotify:** Enjoy `seamless Spotify controls` right from your voice. *(Requires Spotify Premium)*
- ☀️ **Weather Capabilities:** Stay updated with `real-time weather data`.
- 🧠 **Persistant Selective Memory:** Ask Miles to `remember something, ask him to forget it`.
- 🧮 **Calculator:** Don't rely on language model math, Miles can use a `real calculator`.
- 🧩 **Multi-tasker:** Miles can use up to `3 tools at the same time`.
- 🤔 **Context:** `Miles has context` about him, who made him, the app he's in, and who you are through things you ask him to remember.
- 🎙️ **Realistic Voice:** Miles `doesn't sound like a robot, he sounds real`. (Both faster and cheaper than eleven labs for the same quality - OpenAI TTS)
- 🔊 **Wake word:** Our wake word detection is `on par with smart home assistants`.

## 🔥 **Tips and Tricks**
- ‼️ **I strongly recommend you `ask Miles what he can do and what tools he can use`, he is aware of everything he can do when using the `default system prompt`.**
- 💰 **Find it too expensive to run?** Just `ask Miles to be cheaper` and he will switch his language model and ask him to make his system prompt cheaper and he will be more cost effective for you.
- 🪪 **Ask Miles to be Anything** Miles can `manipulate his own personality and instructions`, just ask him to be anything and he will rewrite himself to comply.
- ⚠️ **Things to Note**: When you ask Miles to be cheaper, he will do both of these things:
  1. Switch his model to `GPT-3.5-Turbo`.
  2. Rewrite his system prompt to `reduce the token count by 700 tokens`.
  3. However, in doing both of these things, he will lose most of his functinality and will be less helpful, he `does NOT actually lose any functinality` in doing this, but he may hallucinate that he can't do some of the things you ask him to do. Asking him to write a custom system prompt for a specific list of instructions will help.

💡 **Note:** You need several API keys to use Miles, there are instructions in the app to get them, all of them are free, except OpenAI..

## 📄 **What commands are there?**
`There are no commands`, Miles is powered by a language model, not code, say anything however you like and it will work, want to play Spotify? You can just say this:
- `"Miles, prithee, lend thine ear to Spotify's sweet melodies and grace us with a song that doth stir the soul."`
  ### or this:
- `"Miles, play that one song that was in the spongebob movie."`
  ### or this:
- `"Miles, in yonder digital realm of Spotify, embark thou upon a quest to unleash the timeless lay 'Never Gonna Give You Up', that we may be ensnared in its melodious rapture most unexpected."`

## ✨ **Highlights & Features**
- **Unrestricted Interaction**: M.I.L.E.S has `no token limit`, this means you might be twiddling your thumbs if you submit a long request.
  
- **Intuitive Understanding & Action**: Powered by an advanced `language model`, M.I.L.E.S not only grasps even the most uniquely phrased commands but also proactively executes actions when it deems necessary. It's basically `magic in a bottle`, but not it a bottle, or magic.
  
- **Customization**: Just `ask M.I.L.E.S to change his model` and he will. Miles can also `change his own system prompt on command` or by himself to whatever he wants.
  
- **World Class Wake Word Invocation**: Whether you say `"Hey Miles"`, `"Hi Miles"`, `"What's up Miles"`, `"Miles"`, or literaly any starting phrase that ends with `"Miles"`, the system WILL respond accurately. We have about a `10% fail rate` for hearing if it's been activated, and a 0% accidental activation error rate.
  
- **Advanced Audio Processing**: M.I.L.E.S excels in noisy environments, ensuring accurate command interpretation.
  
- **Graphics & Interface**: Features a `dynamic interface` displaying Spotify song playback, weather cards, user interactions, and ongoing actions.

## 📜 **Changelog**
- 🔊 **Realistic Voice Upgrade with `OpenAI TTS`**: M.I.L.E.S now utilizes `OpenAI TTS` for Text-To-Speech, elevating the voice quality to `ultra-realistic` levels. M.I.L.E.S will seamlessly switch to a `basic TTS` if any errors are detected.
- 📢 **Enhanced Wake Word Detection**: M.I.L.E.S now leverages the same technology used in `leading smart home products` like `Google Home` and `Alexa` for `unmatched wake word detection accuracy`, this means you don't have to wait for the program to listen and stop listening, now it's `always listening`!
- 🔢 **Enhanced Calculator Operations**: M.I.L.E.S now efficiently handles `multiple simultaneous calculations` at the same time.
- 💡 **Improved UI**: Introducing a `graphical interface` for better user interactions.
- 🌦️ **Enhancements**: Augmented `weather data`, `permanent memory`, and `date + time support`.
- 🎲 **Multi-Task Mode** M.I.L.E.S can use up to `3 tools` at once, this means M.I.L.E.S can find the weather in `Shanghai`, calculate the temp difference if it were to drop `23.883 degrees`, and then store it in memory to call upon later, all before he even responds to you. That's the future.
- 💻 **Cross Platform!** M.I.L.E.S now supports `MacOS` and `Windows 10/11`.
- 🎧 **Full Playback Controls** M.I.L.E.S can now `pause`, `unpause`, `toggle playback`, set `spotify volume`, and set `system volume`.
- 🔇 **Smart Audio Management** If you request Miles while a song is playing, he will `pause it to listen`, `unpause at a low volume` while he speaks, and return to the `orginal volume` when he's done talking. Miles also remembers `playback states` and `volume levels`.
- 💾 **Internal Automatic Model Switching** Find that `GPT-4-Turbo` is too expensive? Just ask Miles to change it to the `cheaper one`. It's that simple.
- 🌘 **Dynamic Action Notifications** Miles' UI now shows `what specifically he is doing`, instead of "Searching a song" it'll now say "Searching for `Never gonna give you up`". This is applied for all Actions.
- 🪪 **Internal Automatic Personality switching** M.I.L.E.S can now change his own `system prompt` from what you ask, or by himself. This lets him or you specify `personality traits`, `ways of responding`, and `topics to talk about or avoid`. Think of it like a `instruction set` combined with a `personality desctiption`.
- ⚙️ **Graphical Setup Process** Once you start the app, it will `automaticaly show a setup screen` if you don't already have API keys setup.
- 🧠 **Default Model Change** The **default LLM is now `GPT-3.5-Turbo`**, the only reason for this is that most people `don't have access to GPT-4-Turbo` so `Miles would crash instantly`. If you have access and want to use `GPT-4-Turbo` just **ask Miles to change it to `GPT-4-Turbo`**.
- 🐛 **Error Handling on Front End**: Errors will now display in the action notification when they occur, enhancing user experience by providing immediate feedback.
- 🎧 **Better Audio Input Management**: Automatically switches without giving errors and allows low bitrate devices to work, improving accessibility and reliability.
- 🧮 **LaTeX Math Formatting**: Miles will reply to all math questions in LaTeX format, ensuring that mathematical expressions are displayed correctly and are easy to read.

## 🆕 **In Progress Features**
### Progress on feature: 0% (Not prioritized)
- ⚙️ **Graphical settings and config menu** As much as I want the users of Miles to speak their every command and desire to him without ever clicking buttons or typing, I also don't want people to have to physically change lines of code to get Miles to work. Let's say someone doesn't have access to GPT-4-Turbo, most people don't, since you wouldn't be able to ask Miles to switch the model by himself, you'd have to dig into the main code, so instead, right after I get the api key interface working, i'll be putting both the api key interface, and any config settings including speed and cost optimizing features in a settings menu that will be located in the top right of the app.

### Progress on feature: 50% (Missing front end code to implement)
- 🪙 **Real time response streaming** I am "trying" to add real time streaming on a token by token basis for all responeses, now this by itself doesn't seem like a hard task, but no, this is the most challenging part of Miles that I have ever attempted. Right now, (future employers look away) I literally take print statements and format them to appear on the main interface, this works with responeses that show all at once, but this is "probably" not gonna work with streaming, typically each chunk would be printed at a time, and I would have to print a start and end token, as well as a tool call token to infer when to start and stop the stream on the front end, which is literally not possible with my skill level, it's just too over engineered. So I have to learn socket io management and figure out how to implement that into the app to replace the current method, I *REALLY* don't wanna do this, so I'm just gonna wait for GPT-5 so it can do it for me :).

### Upcoming feature: 100% (Awaiting testing)
- 🌐 **Internet Browsing via Google Search Results**: Completely free, allows Miles to search Google for any search query and get the recommended answer, as well as 3500 characters from the first linked website. 100% complete, but awaiting testing.

## 🙋‍♂️ **About Me**

Hello! I'm a one-man developer team, currently navigating the world of high school. Balancing between academics and passion projects means it might take me a few months to roll out new features for M.I.L.E.S, but I'm always dedicated to delivering the best.

🔍 **My Work Ethic**: At the core of my development philosophy is simplicity and accessibility. I firmly believe that everyone, irrespective of their expertise or financial standing—be it novice or advanced, rich or poor—should have access to cutting-edge technology like M.I.L.E.S. It's for this reason I've committed to keeping M.I.L.E.S free, permanently. Despite the costs I bear to keep this vision alive. I strive to create an interface so intuitive that anyone can harness its full potential with ease, making AI-driven assistance universally accessible.

🌱 **The Origin**: My journey into this world of voice assistants began when I recognized the limitations of platforms like Siri. Eager to bring a more competent solution to the table, I embarked on a self-taught coding expedition. This led to the birth of my initial project, **JarvisChatGPT**, available in my other repository. While JarvisChatGPT was a step in the right direction, emphasizing simplicity, I knew I had the potential to create something even more advanced. Hence, M.I.L.E.S was conceived, a culmination of weeks of learning, testing, and innovating.

Your support fuels my passion, and I'm excited to continue this journey with all of you!
